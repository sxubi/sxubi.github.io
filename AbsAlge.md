**Definition** (Set). A *set* is a collection of objects.       
**Definition.** A statement is a sentence that can have a true value.        
**Definition.** The symbol $$\forall$$ means *for all*. The symbol $$\exists$$ means *there exists*. And $$\exists!$$ means "there exists a unique".    
**Defition** (Equality of sets). $$X$$ is equal to $$Y$$, written as $$X=Y$$ if $$\forall x, x\in X\Leftrightarrow x\in Y.$$     
**Defition** (Subset). $$X$$ is a *subset* of $$Y$$, written as $$X\subseteq Y$$ or $$X\subset Y$$, if all elements in $$X$$ are in $$Y$$, i.e. $$\forall x, x\in X\Rightarrow x\in Y$$.     
**Defition** (Intersection, union, set difference and power set). Given two sets $$X,Y$$,
* Intersection: $$X\cap Y=\{x:x\in X\text{ and }x\in Y\}$$
* Union: $$X\cup Y=\{x:x\in X\text{ or }x\in Y\}$$
* Set difference: $$X\Y=\{x\in X:X\notin Y\}$$
* Power set: $$\mathscr{P}(x)=\{S:S\subseteq X\}$$
