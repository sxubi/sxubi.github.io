Hi! Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About Me
I'm currently a year 2 undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). And I'm majoring in [Physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an extended major in artifitial intelligence.

For research, my current research interest lies on high energy physics experiment (hep-ex). Now I'm doing a research regarding neutrino physics. For my goal, I would like to pursue a PhD in hep-ex in the future.

In 23 Fall, I'm going to [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) as an exchange student through the [UCEAP program](https://reciprocity.uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/).

Here is a statement that I like very much:
> Ten thousand hours of practice is required to reach the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert.
