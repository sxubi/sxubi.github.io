Hi, Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022 for recoding my undergraduate life.  

### About Me
I'm currently a junior undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). I'm majoring in [physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an [extended major in artifitial intelligence](https://join.hkust.edu.hk/our-programs/extended-major-ai).

In 2023 Fall, I'm now an exchange student through the [UCEAP program](https://reciprocity.uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/) in [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).
