Hi, Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About Me
I'm a senior undergraduate student in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), majoring in physics and mathematics. During 2023 Fall, I was a UCEAP reciprocity student in University of California, Berkeley. I'm currently doing a summer research internship at Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics (LASSP), Cornell University.

### Research Interests
My research interest lies on condensed matter physics experiments, especially on 2D Van der Waals materials. At HKUST, I'm focusing on the topological insulator devices and their electrical properties. At Cornell I'm doing TMDs, TMD moir√© and their optical measurements.
