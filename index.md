Hi, Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About Me
I'm a senior undergraduate student at the HKUST, majoring in physics. In 2023 Fall, I was a UCEAP reciprocity student at  Berkeley. During 2024 Summer, I worked in Laboratory of Solid State and Atomic Physics at Cornell.

I'll be pursuing my PhD at Princeton University starting 2025 Fall.

### Research Interests
I'm interested in 2D vdW quantum materials and devices with highly tunable correlated phases, including moiré superlattices of TMDs.
