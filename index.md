Hi! Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About me
I'm currently a year 2 undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). And I'm majoring in [Physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an extended major in Artifitial Intelligence.

For research, I’m interested in theoretical Physics, like hep-th, so I’m recently teach myself group theory and QFT. For my goal, I would like to pursue a PhD in theoretical physics in the future.

Here is a statement that Malcolm Gladwell proposed in his book *Outliers*, which I like very much:
> Ten thousand hours of practice is required to reach the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert.

### Study Notes
I like taking study notes XD. Below are some of my study notes, compiled by $$\LaTeX.$$
* Group Theory Notes [PDF](https://sxubi.github.io/Group_Theory_in_Physics.pdf)
* Quantum Mechanics Notes [PDF](https://sxubi.github.io/Quantum_Mechanics_Notes.pdf)

The following notes are taken by MARKDOWN:
* Multivariable Calculus [link](https://sxubi.github.io/Multivariable_calculus/)
* Linear Algebra [link](https://sxubi.github.io/Linear_Algebra/)
