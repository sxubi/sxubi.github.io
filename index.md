Hi! Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About me
I'm currently a year 2 undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). And I'm majoring in [Physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an extended major in Artifitial Intelligence.

For research, my current research interest lies on high energy physics experiment (hep-ex). Now I'm doing a research regarding neutrino physics. For my goal, I would like to pursue a PhD in either hep-th or hep-ex in the future.

In 23 Fall, I'm going to UC Berkeley as an exchange student through the UCEAP program.

Here is a statement that Malcolm Gladwell proposed in his book *Outliers*, which I like very much:
> <i><font face="Times New Roman">Ten thousand hours of practice is required to reach the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert.</font></i>
