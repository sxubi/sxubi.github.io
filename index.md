Hi, Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About Me
I'm a senior undergraduate student in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), majoring in physics and mathematics. In 2023 Fall, I was a UCEAP reciprocity student in University of California, Berkeley. During 2024 Summer, I was working in Laboratory of Solid State and Atomic Physics at Cornell University.

### Research Interests
I'm interested in condensed matter physics experiments, especially in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) quantum materials and devices with highly tunable correlated phases.
