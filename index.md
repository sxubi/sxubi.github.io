Hi! Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was first created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About me
I'm currently a year 2 undergraduate student in the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). And I'm majoring in [Physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an extended major in Artifitial Intelligence.

For research, I'm still finding my research interest and starting to try different fields. Currently I'm doing some calculations and simulations for the quantum states of some 2-dimensional nanostructures, like lieb lattice, which is a topic related to solid state physics. MATLAB is used to construct the unit cell, solve the Schr\"odinger equation and obtain the total density of states. My work is to simulate some possible cases and find a preferable lattice structure with some special properties.

Besides solid state physics, I’m interested in theoretical Physics, like high energy theory, particle physics and cosmology, so I’m recently teach myself some quantum mechanics. I want to pursue a PhD in theoretical physics in the future.
