Hi, Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About Me
I'm a senior undergraduate student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), majoring in physics. In 2023 Fall, I was a UCEAP reciprocity student in University of California, Berkeley. During 2024 Summer, I worked in Laboratory of Solid State and Atomic Physics at Cornell University.

### Research Interests
I'm interested in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) quantum materials and devices with highly tunable correlated phases, including moiré superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). I'm skilled in 2D device fabrications and have some expereinces in transport, optics and ultrafast spectroscopy measurements.
