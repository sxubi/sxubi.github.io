Hi! Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About me
I'm currently a year 2 undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). And I'm majoring in [Physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an extended major in Artifitial Intelligence.

And this is my [Zhihu page](https://www.zhihu.com/people/chaoszz-27).

For research, Iâ€™m currently doing a research regarding neutrino physics.

Here is a statement that Malcolm Gladwell proposed in his book *Outliers*, which I like very much:
> Ten thousand hours of practice is required to reach the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert.
