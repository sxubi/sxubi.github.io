Hi! Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was first created on Nov 23, 2022.

### About me
I'm currently a year 2 undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). And I'm majoring in [Physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an extended major in Artifitial Intelligence.

For research, I’m interested in theoretical Physics, like high energy theory, particle physics and cosmology, so I’m recently teach myself some quantum mechanics. For my goal, I would like to pursue a PhD in theoretical physics in the future.

### Study Notes
I like taking study notes XD. Below are some of my study notes, compiled by LaTex.
