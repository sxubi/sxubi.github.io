Hi, Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022 for recoding my undergraduate life.  

### About Me
I'm currently a junior undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). I'm majoring in [physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an [extended major in artifitial intelligence](https://join.hkust.edu.hk/our-programs/extended-major-ai).

For research, my current research interest lies on high energy physics experiment (hep-ex). For my goal, I would like to pursue a PhD degree in hep-ex in the near future. Here is a statement that I like very much:
> Ten thousand hours of practice is required to reach the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert.

In 2023 Fall, I'm now an exchange student through the [UCEAP program](https://reciprocity.uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/) in [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).  

My full CV could be found [here](https://sxubi.github.io/cv_June2023.pdf).

### Study Notes
Below are some of my study notes, compiled by $$\LaTeX$$:
* Particle Physics (Martin & Shaw) [PDF](https://sxubi.github.io/particle.pdf)  
  [*Updating*; Last Update: July 06, 2023]
* Quantum Mechanics (Griffiths) [PDF](https://sxubi.github.io/Quantum_Mechanics_Notes.pdf)  
  [*Completed*; Last Update: Dec 26, 2022]
* Classical Mechanics (Fowles & Cassiday) [PDF](https://sxubi.github.io/CM.pdf)   
  [*Completed*; Last Update: Mar 14, 2022]           

Since it's also my first time to learn those topics, the contents may not be very complete or accurate. Other notes taken by *Markdown* can be found in [Posts](https://sxubi.github.io/protectpre.md/).
