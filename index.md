Hi, Welcome to my personal webpage! The webpage was created on Nov 23, 2022 for recoding my undergraduate life.  

### About Me
I'm currently a junior undergraduate student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk). I'm majoring in [physics](https://physics.ust.hk/) and [mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), with an [extended major in artifitial intelligence](https://join.hkust.edu.hk/our-programs/extended-major-ai).

For research, my current research interest lies on high energy physics experiment (hep-ex) and now I'm doing a research regarding neutrino physics. For my goal, I would like to pursue a PhD degree in hep-ex in the near future. Here is a statement that I like very much:
> Ten thousand hours of practice is required to reach the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert.

In 2023 Fall, I'm now an exchange student through the [UCEAP program](https://reciprocity.uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/) in [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

My full CV could be found [here](https://sxubi.github.io/cv_June2023.pdf).
