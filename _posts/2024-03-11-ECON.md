### <center>1 Ten Principles of Economics</center>
#### **1. People face trade-off**           
**Scarcity** (供不应求): The amount of an item is insufficient to satisfy the want of a person or want of people, then scarcity happens for the item for an individual or the society.       
> About "availability" and "want" together.        
> People’s want is larger than the availability then people are willing to pay to obtain it.      

#### **2. Choices and opportunity cost**        
**Opportunity cost** (机会成本) of choosing something is the highest valued **alternative** that you give up.
> When there's no alternative, it's not part of the cost.     
> When there's change in available choices, the cost of the same choice can change.    
> Things happened and not reversible should not be the part of the cost.    

#### **3. Rational people think at the margin**       
Assume people are *rational*, choosing the best alternative when making decisions.    
Due to the lacking information, people sometimes make choices that look like irrational.    
The *margninal unit* (边际单位) is the additional unit. Marginal benifit (cost) is the benefit (cost) of an additional unit. When considering how many units to buy or sell, we think at margin.

#### **4. People respond to incentives**       
People respond to incentives (激励) smartly, out of policy makers' expectation and calculation.

#### **5. Trade can make everyone better off** 

#### **6. Markets are usually a good way to organize econimic activity**

### <center>2  Thinking Like an Economist</center>
**Corrlation**: Two things appear at the same time.       
**Causality**: A makes B happen.     
**Hold other constant**

**Scientific Method**: Observation, theory, and more observation.      

**Normative Analysis**: "What should be", focuses on the value of economic fairness. Involves value judgement.        
**Positve Analysis:** "What it is", focuses on correlation or cause-consequence.

Disagreement could be due to difference in **scientific judgement** or **value judgement**.

### <center>3  Interdependence and the Gains from Trade</center>
**Primary factors of production** (生产要素) are provided by households (一个家庭或个人的消费单位), which include
* Labor (劳动): work and effort from human beings
* Capital (资本): capacity to produce goods and services
* Land (土地): gifts from nature
* Entrepreneur (企业家才能): risk taking in production 

#### Availability of Labor
Labor is not a person but his effort. Labor is more than population.     
**Incentive** is important to induce a person works effectively and efficiently.    
Machinery or tool can improve the productivity of labor.    

#### Availability of Entrepreneur and Land
Entrepreneur to distinguish between “labor effort” and “risk-taking behavior”.    
Land (natural resources) was regarded as fix in old days, but may not be true nowadays. Most land is created by nature.      

#### Availability of Capital
**Capital creation**, or formation.     
An economic decision: **Trade-off** of current and future consumption.      
Accumulation of capital is highly related to productivity and the level of living standard of an society.
> **Example:** Fisherman and fishing     
>  Wing sacrificed some of his current consumption (**saving**) to buy fish net (**investment - capital creation**). With the fishing net, he can get enough to eat and to sell (**return to capital**). Besides supplying his own labor, Wing is the entrepreneur as well since Any profit or loss from the production is borne by Wing.

#### Production - Specialization
**Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)** (生产可能性边界) is always used to illustrate the gain from specialization in Economics.       
A person has **absolute advantage** (绝对优势) at a task over another person if the person needs less resources (time and/or other resources) to perform it.       
A person has **comparative advantage** (相对优势) over another person on a task, if the person’s **opportunity cost** of performing that task is lower than that of the other person.     
**Specialization** (专业化) (in the right way) provides the largest **joint production possibilities set**.       
**Gain from specialization and exchange**. To be mutual acceptable, the exchange ratio is between the opportunity costs of the two persons.         
> PPF only describes the Production Side (Supply Side), we need also the information Demand Side (preferences) to know which exchange ratio will be adopted in their exchange.
