#### Understanding the World Through Data
* *Summary*: A numerical, graphical, or verbal description of an aspect of data that is on hand.
* *Generalization*: A numerical, graphical, or verbal description of a broader set of units than those on which data was been recorded.
* *Causal Claim*: A claim that changing the value of one variable will influence the value of another variable.
* *Prediction*: A guess about the value of an unknown variable, based on other known variables.

### The Taxamony of Data
*Variable*: A characteristic of an object or observational unit that can be measured and recorded.    
*Types of variable*:
<ul><li><i>Numerical Variable</i>: Take numbers as values and where the magnitude of the number has a quantitative meaning.</li><ul>
<li><i>Continuous Numerical Variable</i>: Takes values on an interval of the real number line.</li>
<li><i>Discrete Numerical Variable</i>: Takes values that have jumps between them.</li></ul>
<i>Categorical Variable</i>: Take categories as values. Each unique category is called a level. 
<li><i>Ordinal Categorical Variable</i>: With levels that have a natural ordering.</li>
<li><i>Nominal Categorical Variable</i>: With levels with no ordering.</li></ul>

*Data Frame*: An array that associates the observations (downs the rows) with the variables measured on each observation (across the columns). Each cell stores a value observed for a variable on an observation.        
*Unit of Observation*: The class of object on which the variables are observed.
