## <center>Chapter 7. Energy Bands</center>
### <center>Nearly Free Electron Model</center>
In free electron model we have

$$\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2),\quad k_x,k_y,k_z=0,\quad,\pm\frac{2\pi}{L},\quad\pm\frac{4\pi}{L},\cdots$$

The free electron wavefunctions

$$\psi_\mathbf{k}=\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}),\quad \mathbf{p}=\hbar\mathbf{k}.$$

Bragg reflection of electron waves in crystals is the cause of energy gaps. At Bragg reflection, wavelike solutions of the Schrödinger equation do not exist.

Consider a linear solid of lattice constant $$a$$. The Bragg condition $$(\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{G})^2=k^2\Rightarrow k=\frac\pm{1}{2}G=\pm n\pi/a.$$ The wavefunctions at $$k=\pm\pi/a$$ are not traveling waves, instead they are standing waves:

$$\psi(+)=2\cos(\pi x/a),\quad \psi(-)=2i\sin(\pi x/a).$$

#### *Origin of the Energy Gap*
The 2 standing waves pile up electrons at different regions. The probability density

$$\rho(+)\propto \cos^2(\pi x/a),\quad \rho(-)\propto\sin \pi x/a.$$

Thus the expectation values of the potential energy would be different. The potential energy of $$\rho(+)$$ is lower, while that of $$\rho(-)$$ is higher than the traveling wave. Thus there is an energy gap of width $$E_g$$. 

$$E_g = \int dx U(x)[|\psi(+)|^2-|\psi(-)|^2].$$

### <center>Bloch Functions</center>
**Bloch's Theorem**: The solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a periodic potential must be of the form

$$\psi_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})=u_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}),$$

where $$u_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})$$ has the period of the crystal lattice with $$u_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})=u_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{T})$$. A one-electron wavefunction of this form is called a *Bloch functon* and can be decomposed into a sum of traveling waves. 

### <center>Kronig-Penney Model</center>
Consider the periodic potential

<center><img src="http://sxubi.github.io/photos/solid_state/kronig.png" width = "250"/></center>

* In the region $$0<x<a,\psi=Ae^{iKx}+Be^{-iKx},\epsilon=\hbar^2K^2/2m$$. 
* In the region $$-b<x<0,\psi=Ce^{Qx}+De^{-Qx},U_0-\epsilon=\hbar^2Q^2/2m.$$
* These two regions are related by the Bloch's theorem $$\psi(a<x<a+b)=\psi(-b<x<0)e^{ik(a+b)}.$$ This serves to define the wavevector $$k$$.

We get

$$\frac{Q^2-K^2}{2QK}\sinh Qb\sin Ka+\cosh Qb\cos Ka=\cos k(a+b).$$

In the limit $$b=0, U_0=\infty$$, let $$Q^2ba/2=P$$, $$Q\gg K,Qb\ll 1$$, we have

$$\frac{P}{Ka}\sin Ka+\cos Ka=\cos ka.$$

<center><img src="http://sxubi.github.io/photos/solid_state/kp.png" width = "300"/></center>

Allowed energies are given by $$Ka=\sqrt{2m\epsilon/\hbar^2}a$$. And the function should lies between $$\pm1$$. For other values of enegry there are no travling wave or Bloch-like solutions. Thus the forbidden gaps in the energy spectrum are formed.

### <center>Wave Equation of Electron in a Periodic Potential</center>
$$U(x)$$ is the potential energy of an electron in a linear lattice of constant $$a$$, $$U(x)=U(x+a)$$. $$U(x)$$ could be written as the Fourier series

$$U(x)=\sum_GU_G e^{iGx}=2\sum_{G>0}U_G\cos Gx.$$

For convenience we assume that $$U_0$$ and the crystal is symmetry about $$x=0$$.

The wavefunction can also be written as a Fourier series summed over all values of the wavevector permitted by the boundary conditions

$$\psi=\sum_k C(k)e^{ikx},\quad k\in \mathbb{R}.$$

$$k$$ has the form $$2\pi n/L$$ since they satisfy the periodic boundary conditions over $$L$$. If one $$k$$ is contained in $$\psi$$, then $$k+G$$ is also contained, where $$G$$ is any reciprocal lattice vector. 

The *central equation*

$$(\lambda_k-\epsilon)C(k)+\sum_G U_G C(k-G)=0,\quad \lambda_k=\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}.$$

#### *Crystal Momentum of an Electron*
Properties of the wavevector $$\mathbf{k}$$, used to label the Bloch function:
* Under a crystal lattice translation: $$\psi_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{T})=e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{T}}\psi_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r}).$$
* $$\mathbf{k}$$ fulfills the conservation laws that govern the collision processes in crystals. $$\hbar\mathbf{k}$$ is called the *crystal momentum* of an electron. 

If an electron $$\mathbf{k}$$ absorbs a phonon of wavevector $$\mathbf{q}$$, then the selection rule $$\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{k}'+\mathbf{G}$$. The electron is scattered from state $$\mathbf{k}$$ to state $$\mathbf{k}'$$. 

### <center>Number of Orbitals in a Band</center>
Consider a 3D crystal consisting of $$N$$ primitive cell. Each primitive cell contributes exactly one independent value of $$\mathbf{k}$$ to each energy band. Considering the electron spin, there are $$2N$$ independent orbitals in each energy band. 

If each primitive cell contributes 1 valence electron, the band can be half-filled. And if each primitive cell contributes 2 valence electron, the band can be exactly filled. 

* **Insulator**: the valence electrons exactly fill one or more bands, leaving other empty. When an external field is applied, no continuous way to change the total momentum of the electrons since every accessible is filled. A crystal can be insulator iff the number of valence electrons in a primitive cell is even. 
* **Semimetal**: Even number of valence electrons per primitive cell, but there is band overlap. 
* **Metal**: Bands are half-filled.

## <center>Chapter 8. Semiconductor Crystals</center>
### <center>Band Gap</center>
*Band gap*: difference in energy between the lowest point of the conduction band (*conduction band edge*) and the highest point in valence band (*valence band edge*). When $$T$$ is increased, electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band. The electrons in the conduction band and the vacant orbitals (holes) in the valence band contribute to the electrical conductivity.

* *Direct absorption process*: The threshold of continuous optical absorption at $$\omega_g$$ measures the band gap $$E_g=\hbar\omega_g$$. A photon is absorbed by the crystal with the creation of an electron and a hole.      
* *Indirect absorption process*: The minimum energy gap involves electrons and holes separated by $$\mathbf{k}_c$$. A direct photon transition at the energy of the minimum gap cannot satisfy the law of conservation since the photon wavevectors are negligible. If a phonon of wavevector $$\mathbf{K}$$ and frequency $$\Omega$$ is created, we have 

$$\mathbf{k}\text{(phonon)}=\mathbf{k}_c+\mathbf{K}\cong\mathbf0,\quad \hbar\omega=E_g+\hbar\Omega.$$



### <center>Equations of Motion</center>
Consider a wave packet, which is made up of wavefunctions near a wavevector $$k$$, in an applied electric field. The group velocity $$v_g=d\omega/dk$$. Since $$\omega=\epsilon/\hbar$$, 

$$v_g=h^{-1}d\epsilon/dk,\quad \mathbf{v}=\hbar^{-1}\nabla_\mathbf{k}\epsilon(\mathbf{k}).$$

In terms of external force,

$$\hbar\frac{d\mathbf{k}}{dt}=\mathbf{F}.$$

In a constant magnetic field

$$\hbar\frac{d\mathbf{k}}{dt}$$

#### *Holes*
The vacant orbitals in a filled band are called *holes*. A hole acts as if it has a positive charge $$+e$$.
* $$\mathbf{k}_h=-\mathbf{k}_e.$$
* $$\epsilon_h(\mathbf{k}_h)=-\epsilon_e(\mathbf{k}_e).$$
* $$\mathbf{v}_h=\mathbf{v}_e.$$
* $$m_h=-m_e.$$
* $$\hbar\frac{d\mathbf{k}_h}{dt}=e(\mathbf{E}+\frac{1}{c}\mathbf{v}_h\times\mathbf{B}).$$

The *effective mass* $$m^*$$ is 

$$\frac{1}{m^*}=\frac{1}{\hbar^2}\frac{d^2\epsilon}{dk^2}.$$
