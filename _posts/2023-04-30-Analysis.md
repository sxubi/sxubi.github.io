(**Remark.** \* means that this is an important theorem.)

## <center>Countability</center>
\***Bijection Theorem.** Let $$g:S\to T$$ be a *bijection*. $$S$$ is *countable* iff $$T$$ is *countable*.

\***Countable Subset Theorem.** Let $$A\subseteq B$$. If $$B$$ is countable, then $$A$$ is countable. If $$A$$ is uncountable, then $$B$$ is uncountbale.

\***Countable Union Theorem.** 


## <center>Countinuity</center>
**Definition.** A function $$f:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous at $$x_0\in S$$ iff 

$$\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x)=f(x_0).$$

**Sequential Continuity Theorem.** $$f:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous at $$x_0\in S$$ iff for every $$x_n\to x_0$$ in $$S$$, $$\lim_{n\to\infty}f(x_n)=f(x_0)=f(\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n).$$

**Theorem.** If $$f,g:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ are continuous at $$x_0\in S$$, then $$f\pm g,fg,f/g$$ are countinuous at $$x_0$$.

**Theorem.** If $$f:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous at $$x_0$$, $$f(S)\subseteq S'$$, $$g:S'\to\mathbb{R}$$ is countinous at $$f(x_0)$$, then $$g\circ f$$ is countinous at $$x_0$$.

**Theorem (Sign Preserving Property).** If $$g:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous at $$x_0$$ and $$g(x_0)>0$$, then there is an interval $$I=(x_0-\delta,x_0+\delta)$$ with $$\delta>0$$ such that $$g(x)>0$$ for every $$x\in S\cap I$$.

\***Intermediate Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is *continuous* and $$y_0$$ is between $$f(a)$$ and $$f(b)$$ inclusive, then there exits $$x_0\in[a,b]$$ such that 

$$f(x_0)=y_0.$$

**Extreme Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous, then there are $$x_0,w_0\in[a,b]$$ such that $$f(w_0)\leq f(x)\leq f(x_0)$$ for every $$x\in[a,b]$$. So the range of $$f$$ is $$f([a,b])=[f(w_0),f(x_0)]$$. In particular, $$f$$ is bounded on $$[a,b]$$.

\***Continuous Injection Theorem.** If $$f$$ is *countinuous* and *injective* on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f$$ is strictly *monotone* on $$[a,b]$$ and $$f([a,b])=[f(a),f(b)]$$ or $$[f(b),f(a)]$$.

**Continuous Inverse Theorem.** If $$f$$ is continuous and injective on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f^{-1}$$ is continous on $$f([a,b])$$.

## <center>Differentiation</center>
**Theorem.** If $$f:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ is differentiable at $$x_0$$, then $$f$$ is countinous at $$x_0$$.

\***Rolle's Theorem.** Let $$f$$ be continuous on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. If $$f(a)=f(b)$$, then there exists $$z_0\in(a,b)$$ such that 

$$f'(z_0)=0.$$

\***Mean-Value Theorem.** Let $$f$$ be continuous on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. Then there exists $$x_0\in(a,b)$$ such that

$$f(b)-f(a)=f'(x_0)(b-a).$$

\***Generalized Mean-Value Theorem.** Let $$f,g$$ be continuous on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. Then there exists $$x_0\in(a,b)$$ such that

$$g'(x_0)(f(b)-f(a))=f'(x_0)(g(b)-g(a)).$$

\***Taylor's Theorem** Let $$f:(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}$$ be $$n$$ times differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. For every $$x,c\in(a,b)$$, there exists $$x_0$$ between $$x$$ and $$c$$ such that

$$f(x)=f(c)+\frac{f'(c)}{1!}(x-c)+\frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+\cdots+\frac{f^{(n-1)}(c)}{(n-1)!}(x-c)^{n-1}+\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-c)^n.$$

## <center>Riemann Integral</center>
**Theorem (Integral Criterion).** Let $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ be a bounded function. The function $$f$$ is Riemann integrable on $$[a,b]$$ iff for every $$\varepsilon>0$$, there is a partition $$P$$ of $$[a,b]$$ such that 

$$U(f,P)-L(f,P)<\varepsilon.$$

**Theorem.** If $$f$$ is continuous on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f$$ is integrable on $$[a,b]$$.

**Definition.** A set $$S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$$ is of measure 0 iff for every $$\varepsilon>0$$, there exists intervals $$(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),\cdots$$ such that

$$S\subseteq\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty(a_n,b_n)\quad\text{and}\quad\sum_{n=1}^\infty|a_n-b_n|<\varepsilon.$$

\***Lebesgue's Theorem.** For a bounded function $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$, $$f$$ is integrable on $$[a,b]$$ iff the set 

$$S_f=\{x\in[a,b]:f\text{ is discontinuous at }x\}$$

is of measure 0 ($$f$$ is continuous almost everywhere).

\***Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.** Let $$c,x_0\in[a,b]$$.   
(1) If $$f$$ is integrable on $$[a,b]$$ and continuous at $$x_0\in[a,b]$$, and $$F(x)=\int_c^xf(t)dt$$, then $$F'(x_0)=f(x_0)$$.   
(2) If $$G$$ is differentiable on $$[a,b]$$ with $$G'=g$$ integrable on $$[a,b]$$, then $$\int_a^bg(x)dx=G(b)-G(a).$$

#### Improper Riemann Integral
**Definition.** Let $$I$$ be an interval. Say $$f:I\to\mathbb{R}$$ is locally integrable iff $$f$$ is integrable on every closed and bounded subintervals of $$I$$. Denote this by $$f\in L_\text{loc}(I)$$.

Three cases of improper integrals: (1) Unbounded near one endpoint; (2) Unbounded near both endpoints; (3) Unbounded inside interval.

\***Theorem (p-test).** For $$0<a<\infty$$, $$\int_a^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}dx<\infty$$ iff $$p>1$$. And $$\int_0^a\frac{1}{x^p}dx<\infty$$ iff $$p<1$$.

\***Theorem (Comparison Test).** Suppose $$0\leq f(x)\leq g(x)$$ on $$I$$ and $$f,g\in L_\text{loc}(I)$$. If $$g$$ is improper integrable on $$I$, then $$f$$ is improper integrable on $$I$$. If $$f$$ is not improper integrable on $$I$$, then $$g$$ is not improper integrable on $$I$$.

**Theorem (Absolute Convergence Test).** If $$f$$
