## ยง1.1 Complex Numbers
**Definition** Consider the real vector space $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ and a multiplication $$(a,b)(c,d)=(ac-bd,ad+bc)$$ for all $$a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}$$.
* Each element $$(a,b)$$ is called a *complex number*.
* $$(1,0)$$ is written as $$1$$, and $$(0,1)$$ is written as $$i$$. Thus $$(a,b)$$ is written as $$a+bi$$.
* The *set of all complex number* is denoted by $$\mathbb{C}=\{a+bi:a,b\in\mathbb{R}\}$$.

**Definition** Given a complex number $$z=a+bi$$, $$a$$ is called the *real part* of $$z$$ and denoted by $$\text{Re}z=a$$, and $$b$$ is called the *imaginary part* of $$z$$ and denoted by $$\text{Im}z=a.$$
