## <center>Countinuity</center>
**Definition.** A function $$f:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous at $$x_0\in S$$ iff 

$$\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x)=f(x_0).$$

**Theorem (Sign Preserving Property).** If $$g:S\to\mathbb{R}

**Intermediate Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous and $$y_0$$ is between $$f(a)$$ and $$f(b)$$ inclusive, then there exits $$x_0\in[a,b]$$ such that 

$$f(x_0)=y_0.$$

**Extreme Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous, then there are $$x_0,w_0\in[a,b]$$ such that $$f(w_0)\leq f(x)\leq f(x_0)$$ for every $$x\in[a,b]$$. So the range of $$f$$ is $$f([a,b])=[f(w_0),f(x_0)]$$. In particular, $$f$$ is bounded on $$[a,b]$$.

**Continuous Injection Theorem.** If $$f$$ is countinuous and injective on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f$$ is strictly **monotone** on $$[a,b]$$ and $$f([a,b])=[f(a),f(b)]$$ or $$[f(b),f(a)]$$.

**Continuous Inverse Theorem.** If $$f$$ is continuous and injective on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f^{-1}$$ is continous on $$f([a,b])$$.


## <center>Differentiation</center>
**Rolle's Theorem.** Let $$f$$ be continuous on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. If $$f(a)=f(b)$$, then there exists $$z_0\in(a,b)$$ such that 

$$f'(z_0)=0$$.

**Mean-Value Theorem.** Let $$f$$ be continuous on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. Then there exists $$x_0\in(a,b)$$ such that

$$f(b)-f(a)=f'(x_0)(b-a).$$

**Generalized Mean-Value Theorem.** Let $$f,g$$ be continuous on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. Then there exists $$x_0\in(a,b)$$ such that

$$g'(x_0)(f(b)-f(a))=f'(x_0)(g(b)-g(a)).$$

**Taylor's Theorem.**
