## <center>Countinuity</center>
**Definition.** A function $$f:S\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous at $$x_0\in S$$ iff 

$$\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x)=f(x_0).$$

**Theorem (Sign Preserving Property).** If $$g:S\to\mathbb{R}

\***Intermediate Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous and $$y_0$$ is between $$f(a)$$ and $$f(b)$$ inclusive, then there exits $$x_0\in[a,b]$$ such that 

$$f(x_0)=y_0.$$

**Extreme Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous, then there are $$x_0,w_0\in[a,b]$$ such that $$f(w_0)\leq f(x)\leq f(x_0)$$ for every $$x\in[a,b]$$. So the range of $$f$$ is $$f([a,b])=[f(w_0),f(x_0)]$$. In particular, $$f$$ is bounded on $$[a,b]$$.

**Continuous Injection Theorem.** If $$f$$ is countinuous and injective on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f$$ is strictly **monotone** on $$[a,b]$$ and $$f([a,b])=[f(a),f(b)]$$ or $$[f(b),f(a)]$$.

**Continuous Inverse Theorem.** If $$f$$ is continuous and injective on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f^{-1}$$ is continous on $$f([a,b])$$.


## <center>Differentiation</center>
\***Rolle's Theorem.** Let $$f$$ be continuous on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. If $$f(a)=f(b)$$, then there exists $$z_0\in(a,b)$$ such that 

$$f'(z_0)=0.$$

\***Mean-Value Theorem.** Let $$f$$ be *continuous* on $$[a,b]$$ and *differentiable* on $$(a,b)$$. Then there exists $$x_0\in(a,b)$$ such that

$$f(b)-f(a)=f'(x_0)(b-a).$$

\***Generalized Mean-Value Theorem.** Let $$f,g$$ be *continuous* on $$[a,b]$$ and differentiable on $$(a,b)$$. Then there exists $$x_0\in(a,b)$$ such that

$$g'(x_0)(f(b)-f(a))=f'(x_0)(g(b)-g(a)).$$

\***Taylor's Theorem** Let $$f:(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}$$ be $$n$$ times *differentiable* on $$(a,b)$$. For every $$x,c\in(a,b)$$, there exists $$x_0$$ between $$x$$ and $$c$$ such that

$$f(x)=f(c)+\frac{f'(c)}{1!}(x-c)+\frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+\cdots+\frac{f^{(n-1)}(c)}{(n-1)!}(x-c)^{n-1}+\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-c)^n.$$

**L'Hopital's Rule(0/0)**

## <center>Riemann Integral</center>
**Theorem (Integral Criterion).** Let $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ be a bounded function. The function $$f$$ is *Riemann integrable* on $$[a,b]$$ iff for every $$\varepsilon>0$$, there is a partition $$P$$ of $$[a,b]$$ such that 

$$U(f,P)-L(f,P)<\varepsilon.$$

**Theorem.** If $$f$$ is *continuous* on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f$$ is *integrable* on $$[a,b]$$.

**Definition.** A set $$S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$$ is *of measure* 0 iff for every $$\varepsilon>0$$, there exists intervals $$(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),\cdots$$ such that

$$S\subseteq\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty(a_n,b_n)\quad\text{and}\quad\sum_{n=1}^\infty|a_n-b_n|<\varepsilon.$$

\***Lebesgue's Theorem.** For a *bounded* function $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$, $$f$$ is *integrable* on $$[a,b]$$ iff the set 

$$S_f=\{x\in[a,b]:f\text{ is discontinuous at }x\}$$

is *of measure* 0 ($$f$$ is continuous almost everywhere).
