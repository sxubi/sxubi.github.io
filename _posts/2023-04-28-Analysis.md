### Countinuity
**Intermediate Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous and $$y_0$$ is between $$f(a)$$ and $$f(b)$$ inclusive, then there exits $$x_0\in[a,b]$$ such that $$f(x_0)=y_0$$.

**Extreme Value Theorem.** If $$f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$$ is continuous, then there are $$x_0,w_0\in[a,b]$$ such that $$f(w_0)\leq f(x)\leq f(x_0)$$ for every $$x\in[a,b]$$. So the range of $$f$$ is $$f([a,b])=[f(w_0),f(x_0)]$$. In particular, $$f$$ is bounded on $$[a,b]$$.

**Continuous Injection Theorem.** If $$f$$ is countinuous and injective on $$[a,b]$$, then $$f$$ is strictly monotone on $$[a,b]$$ and $$f([a,b])=[f(a),f(b)]$$ or $$[f(b),f(a)]$$.

**Continuous Inverse Theorem.** If $$f$$ is continuous 


### Differentiation
**Rolle's Theorem.**
