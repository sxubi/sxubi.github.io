### <center>Cyclic Group</center>
Definitions of the cyclic group:
1. It is either isomorphic to the group of integers or to the group of integers modulo $$n$$: $$G\cong \mathbb{Z}$$ or $$G\cong \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$.
2. There exists a $$g\in G$$ such that $$G=\langle g\rangle$$.
3. It is isomorphic to a quotient group of the group of integers $$\mathbb{Z}$$, i.e. there exists a surjective homomorphism from $$\mathbb{Z}$$ to $$G$$.

Properties of the cyclic group:
1. If $$G$$ is a cyclic group and $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$, $$H$$ is also a cyclic group.
2. If $$G$$ is a cyclic group and $$H$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$, the quotient group $$G/H$$ is also a cyclic group.
3.
