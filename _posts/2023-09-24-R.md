#### Creating Vectors
```
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
colors <- c("green","orange","purple")
numbers

[1] 1 2 3 4
```

#### Functions
Functions acting on vectors is equivalent as acting on each single element respectively.
```
mean(numbers)
sqrt(numbers) 
```

#### Class
`Class(VECTOR)` could be used to examine the class of a vector.
```
class(numbers)
[1] "numeric"

class(colors)
[1] "character"
```
Factor is a class in R which encodes the notion of levels:
```
char_vec <- c("cat","cat","dog")
fac <- factor(char_vec)
fac

[1] cat cat dog
Levels: cat dog
```
#### Data Frame
Create a data frame for penguins:
```
bill_length_mm <- c(50.7, 48.5, 52.8, 44.5, 42.0, 46.9, 50.2, 37.9)
bill_depth_mm <- c(19.7, 15.0, 20.0, 15.7, 20.2, 16.6, 18.7, 18.6)
species <- factor(c("Chinstrap", "Gentoo", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo", "Adelie", 
             "Chinstrap", "Chinstrap", "Adelie"))
penguins_df <- data.frame(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, species)
penguins_df

  bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm   species
1           50.7          19.7 Chinstrap
2           48.5          15.0    Gentoo
3           52.8          20.0 Chinstrap
4           44.5          15.7    Gentoo
5           42.0          20.2    Adelie
6           46.9          16.6 Chinstrap
7           50.2          18.7 Chinstrap
8           37.9          18.6    Adelie
```
#### Loading Data from Pakages
```
library(tidyverse)
library(stat20data)
view(penguins) # a data frame named penguins
```
#### Functions on Data Frames
* `select()`: select specific columns
* `arrange()`: sort rows in specific order
* `mutate()`: create a new column with existing columns

```
select(penguins,species,island)
arrange(penguins,bill_length_mm)
# or in a decreasing order: desc(bill_length_mm)
mutate(penguins, bill_index = bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm)
```

#### Filtering and Logical Operators
Filtering is the operation on a data frame that retains the rows based on some column values.
```
filter(msleep, name == "Little brown bat")
filter(msleep, log_bodywt > 12)
filter(msleep, log_bodywt > 12 & sleep_total < 5)
filter(msleep, log_bodywt > 12,  sleep_total < 5)
filter(msleep, log_bodywt > 12 | sleep_total < 5)
filter(msleep, name %in% c("Little brown bat", "African elephant"))
```

#### Logicals
```
a <- c(2,4,6,8)
a < 5

[1] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE

class(a < 5)
[1] logical

sum(a < 5) # TRUE + TRUE = 2
[1] 2

mean(a < 5)
[1] 0.5
```

#### Data Pipelines
The pipe is an easier and faster way to operate the data frame.
```
arubuthnot %>%
    mutate(total = boys + grils) %>%
    arrange(desc(total)) %>%
    select(year,total)
msleep %>%
    filter(vore == "carni") %>%
    summarize(p_gt_8hrs = mean(sleep_total > 8),
              n = n())
```

#### Groupwise Operations
The `group_by()` function can perform calculation based on one particular group of observations in the data set. If `summarize()` is perceded by `group_by()`, it would output multiple rows according to the groups specified by `group_by()`.
```
msleep %>%
    group_by(vore) %>%
    summarize(p_gt_8hrs = mean(sleep_total > 8),
              n = n())
```

#### Data Visualization with *ggplot*
* Aesthetic: `x`, `y`, `color`, `alpha`, `size`, `shape` and `fill`.
* Geometries:`point`, `bar`, `line`, `histogram`, `density`, `violin`, `dotplot` and `boxplot`.

````
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +

#Adding colors

    y = "cryptocurrency will play a\n dominant role in finance")

# Choose a theme for the plot
library(ggthemes)

    y = bill_depth_mm,
    color = species)) +

#### The Correlation Coefficient
````
poverty %>%
  summarize(r = cor(Poverty, Graduates))
````

#### The Least Squares Line
Obtaining the intercept and slope of the least square line.
````
lm(Graduates ~ Poverty, data = poverty) # y ~ x, "poverty" is the data frame

Coefficients:
(Intercept)      Poverty  
    96.2022      -0.8979  
````
Plotting the least square line together with the scatter plot:
```
m1 <- lm(Graduates ~ Poverty, poverty)

ggplot(poverty, aes(x = Poverty, 
                    y = Graduates)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = coef(m1)[2],
              intercept = coef(m1)[1],
              color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Poverty Rate",
       y = "Graduation Rate") +
  theme_bw()
```
