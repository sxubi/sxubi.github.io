### <center>1 Ten Principles of Economics</center>
**1. People face trade-off**           
**Scarcity** (供不应求): The amount of an item is insufficient to satisfy the want of a person or want of people, then scarcity happens for the item for an individual or the society.       
> About "availability" and "want" together.        
> People’s want is larger than the availability then people are willing to pay to obtain it.      

**2. Choices and opportunity cost**        
**Opportunity cost** (机会成本) of choosing something is the highest valued **alternative** that you give up.
> When there's no alternative, it's not part of the cost.     
> When there's change in available choices, the cost of the same choice can change.    
> Things happened and not reversible should not be the part of the cost.    

**3. Rational people think at the margin**       
Assume people are *rational*, choosing the best alternative when making decisions.    
Due to the lacking information, people sometimes make choices that look like irrational.    
The *margninal unit* (边际单位) is the additional unit. Marginal benifit (cost) is the benefit (cost) of an additional unit. When considering how many units to buy or sell, we think at margin.

**4. People respond to incentives**
People respond to incentives (激励) smartly, out of policy makers' expectation and calculation.

**5. Trade can make everyone better off** 

**6. Markets are usually a good way to organize econimic activity**

### <center>2  Thinking Like an Economist</center>
#### Cause and Effect
**Corrlation**: Two things appear at the same time.       
**Causality**: A makes B happen.     
**Hold other constant**

**Scientific Method**: Observation, theory, and more observation.      

**Normative Analysis**: "What should be", focuses on the value of economic fairness. Involves value judgement.        
**Positve Analysis:** "What it is", focuses on correlation or cause-consequence.

Disagreement could be due to difference in **scientific judgement** or **value judgement**.
