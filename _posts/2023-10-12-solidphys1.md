### Periodic Arrays of Atoms
#### *Lattice Translation Vectors*
An ideal crystal is built by the repetition of identical groups of items. A group is called *basis*. The set of points to which the basis is attached is called the *lattice*. 

$$\mathbf{r}'=\mathbf{r}+u_1\mathbf{a}_1+u_2\mathbf{a}_2+u_3\mathbf{a}_3,$$

where $$\mathbf{a}_1,\mathbf{a}_2,\mathbf{a}_3$$ are translation vectors, and $$u_1,u_2,u_3$$ are integers. Definite the *primitive* lattice and the *primitive translation vectors* $$\mathbf a_i$$: There's no cell of smaller volume than $$\mathbf a_1\cdot\mathbf a_2\times\mathbf a_3.$$ The vectors can be used to define the *crystal axes*. 

#### *Basis and the Crystal Stucture*
The position of the center of an atom $$j$$

$$\mathbf{r}_j=x_j\mathbf{a}_1+y_j\mathbf{a}_2+z_j\mathbf{a}_3.$$

The origin is called the *associated lattice point*. 

#### *Primitive Lattice Cell*
The parallelepiped definded by primitive axes is called a *primitive cell*, which is a type of unit cell. There's always 1 lattice point per primitive cell.

### Fundamental Types of Lattice
#### *Two-Dimensional Lattice Types*
*Oblique lattice*: Invariant only under rotation of $$\pi,2\pi$$ about any lattice point.

And there are 4 *special lattice type*.

#### *Three-Dimensional Lattice Types*
Three cubic space lattices: simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc). The conventional cells are shown below.
