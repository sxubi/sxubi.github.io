### 1.1 *Periodic Arrays of Atoms*
#### *Lattice Translation Vectors*
An ideal crystal is built by the repetition of identical groups of items. A group is called *basis*. The set of points to which the basis is attached is called the *lattice*. 

$$\bf r'=\bf r+u_1\bf a_1+u_2\bf a_2+u_3\bf a_3,$$

where $$\bf a_1,\bf a_2,\bf a_3$$ are translation vectors. 

Definite the *primitive* lattice and the *primitive translation vectors* $$\bf a_i$$: There's no cell of smaller volume than $$\bf a_1\cdot\bf a_2\times\bf a_3.$$ The vectors can be used to define the *crystal axes*.
