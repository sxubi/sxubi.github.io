### 1.1 *Periodic Arrays of Atoms*
#### *Lattice Translation Vectors*
An ideal crystal is built by the repetition of identical groups of items. A group is called *basis*. The set of points to which the basis is attached is called the *lattice*. 

$$\bm r'=\bm r+u_1\bm a_1+u_2\bm a_2+u_3\bm a_3,$$

where $$\bm a_1,\bm a_2,\bm a_3$$ are translation vectors. 

Definite the *primitive* lattice and the *primitive translation vectors* $$\bm a_i$$: There's no cell of smaller volume than $$\bm a_1\cdot\bm a_2\times\bm a_3.$$ The vectors can be used to define the *crystal axes*.
