### 1.1 *Periodic Arrays of Atoms*
#### *Lattice Translation Vectors*
An ideal crystal is built by the repetition of identical groups of items. A group is called *basis*. The set of points to which the basis is attached is called the *lattice*. 

$$\bf{r}'=\bf{r}+u_1\bf{a}_1+u_2\bf{a}_2+u_3\bf{a}_3,$$

where $$\bf{a}_1,\bf{a}_2,\bf{a}_3$$ are translation vectors, and $$u_1,u_2,u_3$$ are integers.

Definite the *primitive* lattice and the *primitive translation vectors* $$\bf a_i$$: There's no cell of smaller volume than $$|\bf a_1\cdot\bf a_2\times\bf a_3|.$$ The vectors can be used to define the *crystal axes*. 

#### *Basis and the Crystal Stucture*
The position of the center of an atom $$j$$

$$\bf{r}_j=x_j\bf{a}_1+y_j\bf{a}_2+z_j\bf{a}_3.$$

The origin is called the *associated lattice point*. 

#### Primitive Lattice Cell
The parallelepiped definded by primitive axes is called a *primitive cell*, which is a type of unit cell. There's always 1 lattice point per primitive cell.
