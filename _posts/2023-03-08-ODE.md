This note aims at providing a reference for solving an ODE rapidly.

## <u>1st ODE</u>
#### Autonomous Equations

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y).$$

#### Seperable Equations
Suppose we have

$$M(x)dx+N(y)dy=0.$$

By integration, 

$$\int M(x)dx+\int N(y)dy=C.$$

Given the initial condition $$y(x_0)=y_0$$,

$$\int_{x_0}^{x}M(s)ds+\int_{y_0}^{y}M(s)ds=0.$$

#### 1st Linear Equations
A 1st Linear equation has the form

$$y'+p(t)y=q(t).$$

Introducing the integrating factor

$$\mu(t)=\exp\int p(t)dt,$$

the general solution is given by

$$y(t)=\frac{1}{\mu(t)}\int \mu(t)g(t)dt+C.$$

#### Exact Equations
**(1)** Suppose we have

$$M(x,y)+N(x,y)y'=0.$$

The equation is exact if $$M_y(x,y)=N_x(x,y)$$. Then there exists a $$\psi$$ such that 

$$\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}=M,\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}=N,$$

and the general solution is 

$$\psi(x,y)=C.$$

**(2)** If $$M_y(x,y)\neq N_x(x,y)$$, then the equation is inexact. Multiplying an integrating factor $$\mu(x,y)$$ to convert the equation into an exact one, with

$$(\mu M)_y=(\mu N)_x.$$

If $$\mu=\mu(x)$$, then 

$$\frac{d\mu}{dx}=\frac{M_y-N_x}{N}\mu.$$

If $$\mu=\mu(y)$$, then 

$$\frac{d\mu}{dy}=\frac{M_x-N_y}{M}.\mu$$

#### Euler's Method
The 1st order initial value problem:

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t,y),y(t_0)=y_0.$$

Using the tangent line at $$t_0$$:

$$y=y_0+f(t_0,y_0)(t-t_0).$$

## <u>2nd Linear ODE</u>
A 2nd ODE is **linear** if

$$y''+p(t)y'+q(t)y=0.$$
