This note aims at providing a reference for solving an ODE rapidly.

## 1st ODE
#### Autonomous Equations

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y).$$

#### Seperable Equations
Suppose we have

$$M(x)dx+N(y)dy=0.$$

By integration, 

$$\boxed{\int M(x)dx+\int N(y)dy=C.}$$

Given the initial condition $$y(x_0)=y_0$$,

$$\int_{x_0}^{x}M(s)ds+\int_{y_0}^{y}M(s)ds=0.$$
