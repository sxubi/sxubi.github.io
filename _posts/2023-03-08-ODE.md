This note aims at providing a reference for solving an ODE rapidly.

## 1st ODE
#### Autonomous Equations

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y).$$

#### Seperable Equations
Suppose we have

$$M(x)dx+N(y)dy=0.$$

By integration, 

$$\int M(x)dx+\int N(y)dy=C.$$

Given the initial condition $$y(x_0)=y_0$$,

$$\int_{x_0}^{x}M(s)ds+\int_{y_0}^{y}M(s)ds=0.$$

#### 1st Linear Equations
A 1st Linear equation has the form

$$y'+p(t)y=q(t).$$

Introducing the integrating factor

$$\mu(t)=\exp\int p(t)dt,$$

the general solution is given by

$$y(t)=\frac{1}{\mu(t)}$$
