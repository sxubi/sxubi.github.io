title: "Installing GENIE on Your Linux"
---
This article is written in English. I might write a Chinese version in the future when I'm free.
GENIE Event Generator is an important tool in the simulations of neutrino interactions. This article would briefly introduce how to install GENIE on Linux, based on the author's personal experience recently.
The following are some useful websites which may help a lot in your installation. 
GENIE Website: Click the "Get started" button on the left-handed menu. 
GENIE Manual
Installation of GENIE: Written in Chinese, on the CSDN website.
Installation of ROOT: Written in Chinese, on the CSDN website.
ROOT Website
Now let's get started.  
Step 1. Update Your Linux
I used Ubuntu Linux 22.04 on the virtual machine (parallel desktop) to install GENIE. At the first beginning, I suggest you upgrade your present packages first. Open the terminal and write the command:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
Also check your Python version:
python3 --version
If you don't have Python installed yet, please install Python first.
And you may also install the following packages for the future use:
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool
And the following packages are for ROOT:
sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev cmake g++ gcc binutils libx11-dev libxpm-dev \
libxft-dev libxext-dev python libssl-dev

sudo apt-get install gfortran libpcre3-dev \
xlibmesa-glu-dev libglew-dev libftgl-dev \
libmysqlclient-dev libfftw3-dev libcfitsio-dev \
graphviz-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev \
libldap2-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libkrb5-dev \
libgsl0-dev qtwebengine5-dev

Step 2. Installation of the 3-Party Packages
GENIE requires 6 3-party packages: log4cpp, GSL, libxml2, LHAPDF, Pythia6 and ROOT.
Before you read the following content, I strongly suggest you create two folders named "src" (mean source code) and "installed" first (also you may have your own preferred names). If you don't do this, REMEMBER WHERE YOU HAVE INSTALLER YOUR PACKAGES. Most of those packages need to be extracted, and you may put the extracted folders in the folder "src" and install the packages in the folder "installed".
Simply follow the introduction order. 
1. log4cpp
Get the file here. Extract it and put the file in the folder "src" and open it in the terminal. Remember to create a folder named "log4cpp" in your "installed". This operation is similar for the following packages. Then
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/YOUR/INSTALLED/FOLDER/log4cpp
sudo make
sudo make installed
If the terminal said "cannot guess the build type, you must specify one" when you are configuring, in terminal you type
./configure --prefix=/YOUR/INSTALLED/FOLDER/log4cpp --build=aarch64 
"aarch64" is my machine type.
If you could find the file "liblog4cpp.so" in the "lib" folder of your "log4cpp" in "installed" then you have successfully installed log4cpp. This is similar for the following packages.
2. GSL
Simply type this command in your terminal:
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
3. libxml2
Get the file here.  Do the same operator as I mentioned in log4cpp. Open the folder in the "src" folder by terminal, and type
./configure --prefix=/YOUR/INSTALLED/FOLDER/libxml2
sudo make
sudo make installed
4. LHAPDF
Get the file here. Similarly,
./configure --prefix=/YOUR/INSTALLED/FOLDER/LHAPDF
sudo make
sudo make install
If the terminal says it cannot find python, type the following in your terminal
sudo apt-get install python-dev-is-python3
and try the initial commands again.
5. Pythia6
Building pythia6 is a little bit annoying. Firstly you need to get the GENIE source code from GitHub. Now, find the file named “build_pythia6.sh" from the folder “/src/scripts/build/ext“ in your GENIE source code folder. Put this file to the "installed" folder. Open the "installed" folder in the terminal:
source build_pythia6.sh
It will generate a folder with name like "v-6-xx-xx". Change its name into "Pythia6" for the following operations. Successful installation would generate a file named "libPythia6.so" in the "lib" folder.
6. ROOT
Get the source code from here. You may also use binary files, but I'd like to introduce how you may install ROOT via the source code in case the binary file doesn't work. Don't get the ROOT from Conda, because you have to use the Pythia6 files generated by the source code.
This time put the ROOT source code folder to the "installed" folder named "root-src". And create a new folder named "root". Find the file "FindPythia6.cmake" in the folder /root-src/cmake/modules. Open it and you'll find
set(_pythia6dirs
  ${PYTHIA6}
  $ENV{PYTHIA6}
  ${PYTHIA6_DIR}
  $ENV{PYTHIA6_DIR}
  /cern/pro/lib
  /opt/pythia
  /opt/pythia6
  /usr/lib/pythia
  /usr/local/lib/pythia
  /usr/lib/pythia6
  /usr/local/lib/pythia6)
Add the location of your Pythia6 folder at the bottom:
set(_pythia6dirs
  ${PYTHIA6}
  $ENV{PYTHIA6}
  ${PYTHIA6_DIR}
  $ENV{PYTHIA6_DIR}
  /cern/pro/lib
  /opt/pythia
  /opt/pythia6
  /usr/lib/pythia
  /usr/local/lib/pythia
  /usr/lib/pythia6
  /usr/local/lib/pythia6
  THE/PATH/TO/installed/Pythia6) #ADD YOUR LOCATION OF PYTHIA6 HERE
This helps ROOT to locate your Pythia6. Now open the "root" folder in the terminal and type
cmake -Dpythia6=ON ../root-src
sudo make -jN
sudo make installed
Note that N is the number of processors of your computer. The process would be faster if you add this option.
After that, in your terminal you type
sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
The terminal would open a file and you add the command in the bottom of it:
source /YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/root/bin/thisroot.sh
This helps your computer locate ROOT when you open a new terminal.
Step 3: Set Up GENIE
Now we may install GENIE. Open your terminal and write
export GENIE=/PATH/TO/YOUR/GENIE/SOURCE/CODE
export ROOTSYS=/PATH/TO/installed/root
export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$GENIE/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GENIE/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/log4cpp/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/libxml2/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/Pythia6/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/LHAPDF/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
cd $GENIE
./configure --enable-lhapdf6 --disable-lhapdf5 --prefix=/THE/PATH/THAT/YOU/INSTALL/GENIE
sudo make -jN
sudo make install
Similar as ROOT, we open the file bashrc:
sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
and add the following to the bottom of the file
export GENIE=/PATH/TO/YOUR/GENIE/SOURCE/CODE
export ROOTSYS=/PATH/TO/installed/root
export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$GENIE/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GENIE/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/log4cpp/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/libxml2/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/Pythia6/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/PATH/TO/installed/LHAPDF/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
cd $GENIE
This helps your computer locate GENIE when you open a new terminal.
Congratulations. Now you have set up GENIE in your Linux. You may also refer to the other websites that I listed at the beginning to install your GENIE.
