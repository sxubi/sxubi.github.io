#### 1.1 The Division Algorithm
**Well Ordering Axiom.** Every nonempty subset of the set of nonnegative integers contains a smallest element.

**Theorem 1.1 (The Division Algorithm).** Let $$a,b$$ be integers with $$b>0$$. Then there exists unique integers $$q$$ and $$r$$ such that

$$a=bq+r,\quad 0\leq r<b.$$

**Corollary 1.2 (The Division Algorithm).** Let $$a,c$$ be integers with $$c\neq0$$. Then there exists unique integers $$q$$ and $$r$$ such that

$$a=cq+r,\quad 0\leq r<|c|.$$

#### 1.2 Divisibility
**Definition.** Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be integers with $$b\neq0$$. We say $$\boldsymbol b$$ **divides** $$\boldsymbol a$$ (or that $$b$$ is a divisor of $$a$$, or that $$b$$ is a factor of $$a$$)if $$a=bc$$ for some integer $$c$$. In symbols, "$$b$$ divides $$a$$" is written $$b|a$$ and "$$b$$ does not divide a$$" is written $$b\nmid a$$.
