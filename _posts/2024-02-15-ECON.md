### <center>1 Ten Principles of Economics</center>
#### 1. People Face Trade-Off
**Scarcity**(供不应求): The amount of an item is insufficient to satisfy the want of a person or want of people, then scarcity happens for the item for an individual or the society.       
> About "availability" and "want" together.        
> People’s want is larger than the availability then people are willing to pay to obtain it.      

#### Choices and Opportunity Cost
**Opportunity cost**(机会成本) of choosing something is the highest valued **alternative** that you give up.
> When there's no alternative, it's not part of the cost.     
> When there's change in available choices, the cost of the same choice can change.    
> Things happened and not reversible should not be the part of the cost.
