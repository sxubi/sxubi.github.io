### The Taxamony of Data
*Variable*: A characteristic of an object or observational unit that can be measured and recorded.    
*Types of variable*:
* *Continuous Numerical Variable*: A numerical variable that takes values on an interval of the real number line.
* *Discrete Numerical Variable*: A numerical variable that takes values that have jumps between them.
* *Ordinal Categorical Variable*: A categorical variable with levels that have a natural ordering.
* *Nominal Categorical Variable*: A categorical variable with levels with no ordering.

*Data Frame*: An array that associates the observations (downs the rows) with the variables measured on each observation (across the columns). Each cell stores a value observed for a variable on an observation.        
*Unit of Observation*: The class of object on which the variables are observed.
