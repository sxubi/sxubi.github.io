The purpose of this post is to show some equations for Multivariable Calculus.

#### Global Values
Suppose $$f$$ is a continous function on a closed and bounded region $$R$$ on the $$xy$$-plane.

(1) List the interior points of $$R$$ where $$f$$ may have local maxima and mimima;

(2) List the boundary points of $$R$$ where $$f$$ may have local maxima and mimima;

(3) Look through the lists for the maximum and minimum values of $$f$$.


#### Lagrange Multiplier
Suppose there's a point $$P(a,b,c)$$ such that $$w=f(x,y,z)$$ has a maximum or minimum value at $$P(a,b,c)$$ subject to the constraint $$g(x,y,z)=k$$. Then the point is given by

$$ \nabla f(a,b,c)=\lambda\nabla g(a,b,c)\quad\text{and}\quad g(a,b,c)=k.$$

#### Double Integral on Rectangular Region
Suppose $$z=f(x,y)$$ is a continuous function on region $$R:a\leq x\leq b, c\leq y\leq d.$$ Then 

$$\iint_R f(x,y)dA=\int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y)dydx=\int_c^d \int_a^b f(x,y)dxdy.$$

Suppose $$z=f(x,y)$$ is a continuous function on region
