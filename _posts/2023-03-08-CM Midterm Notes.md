### Oscillations
#### Undamped Oscillation
Consider $$m\ddot{x}+kx=0$$. The general solution is given by 


#### Nondriven Damped Oscillation
Now we have $$m\ddot{x}+b\dot{x}+kx=0.$$ The characteristic equation is $$mr^2+br+k=0$$.   
(1) **Underdamped**: $$b<\sqrt{2mk}$$. Suppose $$r=\lambda\pm\mu$$. The general solution is

$$x(t)=c_1e^$$

#### Driven Oscillation


### Projectile of Motion


### Non-Inertial Frame of Reference


### Conservative Force
