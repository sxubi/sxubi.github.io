### Degree of Freedom
In 3-dimensional space, the degree of freedom of a rigid body is 6 (3 translational and 3 rotational). In 2-dimensional space, the degree of freedom of a rigid body is 3 (2 translational and 1 rotational).

### Center of Mass
For a 3-dimensional body, the center of mass is given by

$$x_{cm}=\frac{\int_v\rho x\,dv}{\int_v \rho\,dv},\quad
y_{cm}=\frac{\int_v\rho y\,dv}{\int_v \rho\,dv},\quad
z_{cm}=\frac{\int_v\rho z\,dv}{\int_v \rho\,dv}.$$

### Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia tensor is given by

$$\usepackage{bm}
\bm I=\sum_im_ir_i^2\bm{1}-\sum_im_i\bm r_i\bm r_i,$$
