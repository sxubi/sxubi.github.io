This post aims to conclude some common algorithm in Linear Algebra, since I guess there would be many calculations in our final exam. LOL

#### Row reduced echelon form (RREF)
Just perform the **elementary row operations**: replacement, scaling and interchange.

#### Solutions of linear system
For a matrix $$A$$, do row operations to $$RREF(A)$$.
* The system has 0 solutions if the last column is a pivot column.
* The system has 1 solutions if the last column is not a pivot column and there are no free variables.
* Otherwise the system has infinitely many solutions.

#### One-to-one and onto functions
