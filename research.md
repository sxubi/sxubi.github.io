* **Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP)**      
  *Department of Physics, HKUST*                 
  **Duration**: Sep 2022 - Dec 2022   
  **Project**: Quantum State Calculation of 2D Supramolecular Nanostructures     
  **Supervisor**: [Prof. Nian Lin](https://physics.ust.hk/eng/people_detail.php?pplcat=1&id=18)       
  **Abstract**: Using MATLAB to simulate quantum states of lieb lattice. Tight-binding model and hopping parameters are used to qualitatively explain how the parameters of lieb lattice affect the band structure.
