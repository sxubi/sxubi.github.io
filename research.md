**Quantum State Calculation of 2D Supramolecular Nanostructures**
* Supervisor: Prof. LIN Nian
* An ideal lieb lattice has many special properties, because of its special flat band structure. However, it’s hard to achieve an ideal lieb lattice in reality as we can’t manipulate the hopping parameters between different atoms as we want. In this project, MATLAB is used to construct the unit cell and simulate the lieb lattice in reality. Different methods are conducted to make the band structure get close to an ideal one. Using the hopping parameters in the tight-binding model, we propose a qualitative explanation of how the band structure are affected by the parameters of the lieb lattice.
